# Overview <a id="Overview"></a>
Our changing climate has increased the frequency of extreme events, and this has been most noticeable in recent years. From an insurance perspective, to mitigate loss and damage associated with extreme weather events, households can purchase climate risk insurance policies. Furthermore, the increase in extreme weather events means that there is a greater need for insurers to factor in climate risk scenarios into their models for insurance claims pay-out. 

In this project, we aim to provide a fictitious stakeholder, namely a new entrant into the market for providing flood insurance policies, recommendations about the value this market provides. Namely, we seek to study and answer the following questions:

1. What does the current distribution of flood insurance policies and flood insurance claims look like?
2. Are there under-served, markets, that is, regions where the voluntary adoption of flood insurance policies is low, yet the risk of flooding is high? Identification of such regions could indicate profitable markets to enter and provide flood insurance policies.
3. For asset-liabilities risk management of our stakeholder, we create a machine learning model to predict flood claims that are likely to be approved.

# Regulatory Details <a id="regulatory-details"></a>
* The Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA") administers the National Flood Insurance Program, a federally backed program that delivers flood insurance coverage to the public by way of a network of more than 50 insurance companies and through direct purchase from FEMA.
* The maximum limits available through NFIP are: $250,000 for all one- to four- family residential buildings, and contents coverage of $100,000; $500,000 for non-condominium residential buildings with five or more units, and contents coverage of $100,000; $500,000 for building and contents coverage for non-residential businesses and other non-residential buildings.
* Prior to 2019, flood insurance was only available for purchase as part of NFIP through FEMA. However, after 2019, private insurers are able to offer flood insurance coverage in excess of the FEMA limits.
* Purchase of flood insurance through FEMA is mandatory for buildings located in Special Flood Hazard Areas ("SFHAs"). SFHAs do not neatly overlap with zip codes, that is, areas within a zip code can be classified as SFHA. Outside of SFHAs, purchase of flood insurance policies is voluntary.  

# Data Sources  <a id="data-sources"></a>
The data on NFIP policies is obtained from the the [FEMA website](https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/fima-nfip-redacted-policies-v1) from 2002-2022. There are approximately 61 million insurance policy transactions in the dataset. Key variables include insurance coverage amount on buildings/contents, policy start date, occupancy type, flood zone, and geographic characteristics such as zip codes, county codes and states. 

The data on NFIP claims is obtained from the [FEMA website](https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/fima-nfip-redacted-claims-v1) from 1977-2022. There are approximately 2.5 million insurance claims in the dataset. Key variables include the amount paid on building/contents damage, date of damage, property age, occupancy type, elevation level, flood zone, and geographic characteristics such as zip codes, county codes and states.  

U.S. Census Data is obtained via the [CORGIS Dataset Projectâ€™s County Demographics Python Library](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/python/county_demographics/). Key variables include the number of households and median house price value, obtained for each county.

There are four main findings from the figures above:
1. The number of flood insurance claims filed per year, and the total amount paid out has increased dramatically in recent years.
2. Voluntary flood insurance adoption rates are highest in along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Most of the U.S. does not voluntarily purchase flood insurance policies. 
3. Flood insurance claims paid out are not only high along high along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, but also along the Mississippi, New England, around Denver, and the Pacific Northwest. 
4. Among residential households that voluntarily purchase flood insurance policies, those in the Mid-West, New England and along the Pacific Coast are the most under-insured with respect to flood risk.

# Prediction of Insurance Claim Approvals <a id="ml-claims-prediction"></a>
For reliable capital planning for our stakeholder, we need to know as precisely as possible, how many claims we can expect to be accepted or rejected. Predicting this purely from the past ratio of approvals and rejections is a good start, but what if we can take into account the actual mix of new customers as to whether their claims are more likely to be approved or rejected? We therefore develop a classifier model for claim approval or rejection. 

In our machine learning model, we classify 1 as the insurance claim was accepted, and 0 if the insurance claim was rejected. An insurance claim is accepted if the amount paid on building/contents damage is greater than 0.

## Features Used and Feature Engineering <a id="features"></a>
* We use various categorical, time, geographic, and numerical variables as features in our model. For more details on the variables used, click [here.](./notebooks/pipeline_xgboost_new.ipynb) 
* All categorical features are one-hot encoded.
* All numerical features are standardized.


## Model Training and Testing <a id="model-train-test"></a>
* The purpose of our model is to predict claim approvals in the cross-section, and not to predict the time-series fluctuations in claim approvals. As such, our train-test split has no time-series component. 
* We use 75% (1,927,566 observations) in our training set, and 25% (642,523 observations) in our test set.
* We stratify our sample to ensure that the same ratio of claim approvals and rejections is the same in both the train and test sets. 

## Model Metrics <a id="metrics"></a>
* Minimizing false positives and false negatives would be important for our stakeholder.
* False Positives
    * Claims that are predicted to be approved but are actually rejected. 
    * Assuming that our stakeholder determines their capital requirements based on their predictions, in this case they would hold too much money on their balance sheet. 
    * This represents an "opportunity cost", that is, the money could have been invested in assets yielding a higher rate of return.   
* False Negatives
    * Claims that are predicted to be rejected but are actually approved.
    * Assuming that our stakeholder determines their capital requirements based on their predictions, in this case they would pay out more claims than predicted.
    * The stakeholder could therefore borrow this shortfall amount on the capital market to pay out these claims.
* Since false positives and false negatives would both be important for our stakeholder, we focus on the **weighted average F1-Score** as a measure of model evaluation and performance.

## Model Results <a id="results"></a>
For insurance claims classification, we run two models: 
  
* Proportions Model: This is our baseline model. In the data, 76% of the actual claims are approved. We apply this percentage and assume that 76% of the actual approved claims are predicted to be approved; 24% of the actual rejected and predicted to be rejected.

* XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning.

Our approach for hyperparameter tuning for XGBoost is to: 
1. Choose a random sample of 10% of the training data after the train-test split.
2. Run a randomized grid search with 5-fold cross validation.
3. Apply the chosen hyperparameters to the full test data.

For the actual hyperparameters used in the XGBoost model, please refer [here.](./notebooks/pipeline_xgboost.ipynb)

The table below shows results on the test set for the two models.

|Model|Weighted-Average F1-Score|
|--|--:|
|Proportions Model (Baseline)|0.635|
|XGBoost|0.736|


## Error Analysis <a id="errors"></a>
![confusion_matrix_prop](./images/confusion_matrix_prop.png)

![confusion_matrix_xgb](./images/confusion_matrix_xgb.png)

* Relative to the baseline model, XGBoost has a slight increase in false positives, but drastically reduces the number of false negatives. This indicates that our model has slightly worse performance at correctly predicting claim approvals.

## Business Value <a id="business-value"></a>
To calculate the monetary loss under the baseline model and under the XGBoost model, we make the following assumptions:
* Average claim size for false positive classifications is the same as false negative classifications.
* The stakeholder allocates their capital requirements based on the prediction number of claim approvals and non-approvals at the start of each year.
* Assume that our stakeholder can borrow at the risk-free rate when capital on their balance sheet is not enough to meet claim pay-outs. 
* Assume that our stakeholder forgoes the average S&P500 market return when they hold too much capital on their balance sheet.

The table below compares the dollar value of claims misclassification per year, for the baseline model and the XGBoost model.

||Proportions Model (Baseline)|XGBoost Model|
|--|--:|--:|
|False Positives|$67.7 million|$71.3 million|
|False Negatives|$64.5 million|$60.6 million|
|Total|**$132.3 million**|**$77.3 million**|

XGBoost therefore reduces loss to our stakeholder of **$54.9 million per year!**

The average dollar value per year is calculated as follows:
```
Average $ Value of False Positives/Year = Total Number of False Positives x Average Claim Size x (1/Number of Years) x (1 + Average S&P500 Market Return)

Average $ Value of False Negatives/Year = Total Number of False Negatives x Average Claim Size x (1/Number of Years) x (1 + Average Risk-Free Rate)

Number of Years = 45 (difference between 2022 and 1977)
Average Claim Size = $24,299.00 (estimated from the claims data)
Average S&P500 Market Return = 7% p.a. 
Average Risk-Free Rate = 2% p.a.
```

# Recommendations <a id="recommendations"></a>
* Counties along the Mississippi, the Pacific Northwest, around Denver, and New England show a high amount of property damage from floods. These could be underserved markets, because flood insurance adoption rates are low, yet pay-outs are high. Our stakeholder can increase revenue by selling flood insurance policies in these areas.
* Households in the Mid-West, New England and the Pacific coasts that voluntarily purchase flood insurance are largely underâ€“insured relative to FEMA maximum insurance coverage. Our stakeholder could offer more insurance protection for these households, thereby generating more revenue from insurance premiums. 
* XGBoost for prediction of insurance claims can reduce losses for our stakeholder by approximately **$54.9 million per year.**

# Future Work <a id="future"></a>
* We would like to examine whether the number of flood insurance policies bought can be explained using historic insurance claims. 
    * The motivation of this comes from our data analysis which shows that after regional flood events, there is a contemporaneous increase in insurance claims and a future increase in voluntary flood insurance policies bought in the region.
    * There is no significant increase in claims and voluntary flood insurance policies bought in other regions not affected by the flood event.
    * For analysis after the Louisiana Floods in 2016, refer [here.](./notebooks/states_eda.ipynb)

* We would like to estimate the elasticity of flood insurance adoption with respect to insurance premiums. 
    * The purpose of this analysis is to see how responsive the purchase of voluntary flood insurance is to changes in insurance premiums.
    * This analysis can yield new public policy insights, for example, are there certain regions that the government should subsidize if flood insurance adoption rates are very elastic? 
    * To estimate the elasticity, we would use techniques from CausalML.
